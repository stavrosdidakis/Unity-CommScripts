## 🎮 Scenes

### 🌐 `UDP Communication Scene`
A dynamic UDP communication demo, showcasing both a **UDP server** and a **UDP client** within Unity.

```csharp
// Features:
- UDPServer: Listens on a specified port for incoming UDP packets.
- UDPClient: Sends a UDP packet every time any key is pressed.
- Configurable IP address and port in the Unity Inspector.
```

---

### 📡 `TCP Communication Scene`
A robust TCP communication setup that includes both a **TCP server** and a **TCP client**.

```csharp
// Features:
- TCPServer: Accepts multiple TCP clients, logs incoming messages, and broadcasts them to all connected clients.
- TCPClient: Connects to the server and sends data whenever any key is pressed.
- Configurable IP address and port in the Unity Inspector.
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
- Each scene is self-contained — simply load the desired scene in Unity and press **Play**.
- IP addresses and ports are **configurable** in the Unity Inspector for maximum flexibility.
- Extend these scripts for real-time multiplayer games, interactive installations, or data-driven artwork.
